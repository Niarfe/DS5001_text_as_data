## Trying to steer answers to stay within the bounds of the analyzed reading
```
For the following questions, treat the summaries I provide as the primary and authoritative context.
Answer as someone reasoning within the conceptual framework, terminology, and conventions of those texts, even when alternative modern definitions exist.
Prefer historically and pedagogically appropriate interpretations over generic or cross-disciplinary ones.
